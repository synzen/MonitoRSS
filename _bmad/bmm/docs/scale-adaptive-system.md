# BMad Method Scale Adaptive System

**Automatically adapts workflows to project complexity - from quick fixes to enterprise systems**

---

## Overview

The **Scale Adaptive System** intelligently routes projects to the right planning methodology based on complexity, not arbitrary story counts.

### The Problem

Traditional methodologies apply the same process to every project:

- Bug fix requires full design docs
- Enterprise system built with minimal planning
- One-size-fits-none approach

### The Solution

BMad Method adapts to three distinct planning tracks:

- **Quick Flow**: Tech-spec only, implement immediately
- **BMad Method**: PRD + Architecture, structured approach
- **Enterprise Method**: Full planning with security/devops/test

**Result**: Right planning depth for every project.

## How Track Selection Works

When you run `workflow-init`, it guides you through an educational choice:

### 1. Description Analysis

Analyzes your project description for complexity indicators and suggests an appropriate track.

### 2. Educational Presentation

Shows all three tracks with:

- Time investment
- Planning approach
- Benefits and trade-offs
- AI agent support level
- Concrete examples

### 3. Honest Recommendation

Provides tailored recommendation based on:

- Complexity keywords
- Greenfield vs brownfield
- User's description

### 4. User Choice

You choose the track that fits your situation. The system guides but never forces.

**Example:**

```
workflow-init: "Based on 'Add user dashboard with analytics', I recommend BMad Method.
               This involves multiple features and system design. The PRD + Architecture
               gives AI agents complete context for better code generation."

You: "Actually, this is simpler than it sounds. Quick Flow."

workflow-init: "Got it! Using Quick Flow with tech-spec."
```

---

## The Three Tracks

### Track 1: Quick Flow

**Definition**: Fast implementation with tech-spec planning.

**Time**: Hours to 1 day of planning

**Planning Docs**:

- Tech-spec.md (implementation-focused)
- Story files (1-15 typically, auto-detects epic structure)

**Workflow Path**:

```
(Brownfield: document-project first if needed)
↓
Tech-Spec → Implement
```

**Use For**:

- Bug fixes
- Simple features
- Enhancements with clear scope
- Quick additions

**Story Count**: Typically 1-15 stories (guidance, not rule)

**Example**: "Fix authentication token expiration bug"

**AI Agent Support**: Basic - minimal context provided

**Trade-off**: Less planning = higher rework risk if complexity emerges

---

### Track 2: BMad Method (RECOMMENDED)

**Definition**: Full product + system design planning.

**Time**: 1-3 days of planning

**Planning Docs**:

- PRD.md (functional and non-functional requirements)
- Architecture.md (system design)
- UX Design (if UI components)
- Epics and Stories (created after architecture)

**Workflow Path**:

```
(Brownfield: document-project first if needed)
↓
(Optional: Analysis phase - brainstorm, research, product brief)
↓
PRD → (Optional UX) → Architecture → Create Epics and Stories → Implementation Readiness Check → Implement
```

## Brownfield Projects

### Critical First Step

For ALL brownfield projects: Run `document-project` BEFORE planning workflows.

### Why document-project is Critical

**Quick Flow** uses it for:

- Auto-detecting existing patterns
- Understanding codebase structure
- Confirming conventions

**BMad Method** uses it for:

- Architecture inputs (existing structure)
- Integration design
- Pattern consistency

**Enterprise Method** uses it for:

- Security analysis
- Integration architecture
- Risk assessment

### Brownfield Workflow Pattern

## Best Practices

### 1. Document-Project First for Brownfield

Always run `document-project` before starting brownfield planning. AI agents need existing codebase context.

### 2. Trust the Recommendation

If `workflow-init` suggests BMad Method, there's probably complexity you haven't considered. Review carefully before overriding.

### 3. Start Smaller if Uncertain

Uncertain between Quick Flow and Method? Start with Quick Flow. You can create PRD later if needed.

### 4. Don't Skip Implementation Readiness Check

For BMad Method and Enterprise, implementation readiness checks prevent costly mistakes. Invest the time.

### 5. Architecture is Optional but Recommended for Brownfield

Brownfield BMad Method makes architecture optional, but it's highly recommended. It distills complex codebase into focused solution design.

### 6. Discovery Phase Based on Need

Brainstorming and research are offered regardless of track. Use them when you need to think through the problem space.

### 7. Product Brief for Greenfield Method

Product Brief is only offered for greenfield BMad Method and Enterprise. It's optional but helps with strategic thinking.

## Key Differences from Legacy System

### Old System (Levels 0-4)

- Arbitrary story count thresholds
- Level 2 vs Level 3 based on story count
- Confusing overlap zones (5-10 stories, 12-40 stories)
- Tech-spec and PRD shown as conflicting options

### New System (3 Tracks)

- Methodology-based distinction (not story counts)
- Story counts as guidance, not definitions
- Clear track purposes:
  - Quick Flow = Implementation-focused
  - BMad Method = Product + system design
  - Enterprise = Extended with security/ops
- Mutually exclusive paths chosen upfront
- Educational decision-making

---

## Migration from Old System

If you have existing projects using the old level system:

- **Level 0-1** → Quick Flow
- **Level 2-3** → BMad Method
- **Level 4** → Enterprise Method

Run `workflow-init` on existing projects to migrate to new tracking system. It detects existing planning artifacts and creates appropriate workflow tracking.
