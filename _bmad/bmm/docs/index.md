## 🎯 Choose Your Path

### I need to...

**Build something new (greenfield)**
→ Start with [Quick Start Guide](./quick-start.md)
→ Then review [Scale Adaptive System](./scale-adaptive-system.md) to understand tracks

**Fix a bug or add small feature**
→ Go to [BMAD Quick Flow](./bmad-quick-flow.md) for rapid development
→ Or use [Quick Flow Solo Dev](./quick-flow-solo-dev.md) directly

**Work with existing codebase (brownfield)**
→ Read [Brownfield Development Guide](./brownfield-guide.md)
→ Pay special attention to documentation requirements for brownfield projects

**Understand planning tracks and methodology**
→ See [Scale Adaptive System](./scale-adaptive-system.md)
