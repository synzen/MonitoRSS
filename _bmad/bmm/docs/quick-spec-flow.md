# BMad Quick Spec Flow

**Perfect for:** Bug fixes, small features, rapid prototyping, and quick enhancements

**Time to implementation:** Minutes, not hours

---

## What is Quick Spec Flow?

Quick Spec Flow is a **streamlined alternative** to the full BMad Method for Quick Flow track projects. Instead of going through Product Brief → PRD → Architecture, you go **straight to a context-aware technical specification** and start coding.

### When to Use Quick Spec Flow

✅ **Use Quick Flow track when:**

- Single bug fix or small enhancement
- Small feature with clear scope (typically 1-15 stories)
- Rapid prototyping or experimentation
- Adding to existing brownfield codebase
- You know exactly what you want to build

❌ **Use BMad Method or Enterprise tracks when:**

- Building new products or major features
- Need stakeholder alignment
- Complex multi-team coordination
- Requires extensive planning and architecture

💡 **Not sure?** Run `workflow-init` to get a recommendation based on your project's needs!

## Single Atomic Change

**Best for:** Bug fixes, single file changes, isolated improvements

### What You Get

1. **tech-spec.md** - Comprehensive technical specification with:
   - Problem statement and solution
   - Detected framework versions and dependencies
   - Brownfield code patterns (if applicable)
   - Existing test patterns to follow
   - Specific file paths to modify
   - Complete implementation guidance

2. **story-[slug].md** - Single user story ready for development

### Quick Spec Flow Commands

```bash
# Start Quick Spec Flow (no workflow-init needed!)
# Load PM agent and run tech-spec

# When complete, implement directly:
# Load DEV agent and run dev-story
```

### What Makes It Quick

- ✅ No Product Brief needed
- ✅ No PRD needed
- ✅ No Architecture doc needed
- ✅ Auto-detects your stack
- ✅ Auto-analyzes brownfield code
- ✅ Auto-validates quality
- ✅ Story context optional (tech-spec is comprehensive!)

### Example Single Change Scenarios

- "Fix the login validation bug"
- "Add email field to user registration form"
- "Update API endpoint to return additional field"
- "Improve error handling in payment processing"

---

## Coherent Small Feature

**Best for:** Small features with 2-3 related user stories

### What You Get

1. **tech-spec.md** - Same comprehensive spec as single change projects
2. **epics.md** - Epic organization with story breakdown
3. **story-[epic-slug]-1.md** - First story
4. **story-[epic-slug]-2.md** - Second story
5. **story-[epic-slug]-3.md** - Third story (if needed)

### Quick Spec Flow Commands

```bash
# Start Quick Spec Flow
# Load PM agent and run tech-spec

# Optional: Organize stories as a sprint
# Load SM agent and run sprint-planning

# Implement story-by-story:
# Load DEV agent and run dev-story for each story
```

### Story Sequencing

Stories are **automatically validated** to ensure proper sequence:

- ✅ No forward dependencies (Story 2 can't depend on Story 3)
- ✅ Clear dependency documentation
- ✅ Infrastructure → Features → Polish order
- ✅ Backend → Frontend flow

### Example Small Feature Scenarios

- "Add OAuth social login (Google, GitHub, Twitter)"
- "Build user profile page with avatar upload"
- "Implement basic search with filters"
- "Add dark mode toggle to application"

---

## Smart Context Discovery

Quick Spec Flow automatically discovers and uses:

### 1. Existing Documentation

- Product briefs (if they exist)
- Research documents
- `document-project` output (brownfield codebase map)

### 2. Project Stack

- **Node.js:** package.json → frameworks, dependencies, scripts, test framework
- **Python:** requirements.txt, pyproject.toml → packages, tools
- **Ruby:** Gemfile → gems and versions
- **Java:** pom.xml, build.gradle → Maven/Gradle dependencies
- **Go:** go.mod → modules
- **Rust:** Cargo.toml → crates
- **PHP:** composer.json → packages

### 3. Brownfield Code Patterns

- Directory structure and organization
- Existing code patterns (class-based, functional, MVC)
- Naming conventions (camelCase, snake_case, PascalCase)
- Test frameworks and patterns
- Code style (semicolons, quotes, indentation)
- Linter/formatter configs
- Error handling patterns
- Logging conventions
- Documentation style

### 4. Convention Confirmation

**IMPORTANT:** Quick Spec Flow detects your conventions and **asks for confirmation**:

```
I've detected these conventions in your codebase:

Code Style:
- ESLint with Airbnb config
- Prettier with single quotes, 2-space indent
- No semicolons

Test Patterns:
- Jest test framework
- .test.js file naming
- expect() assertion style

Should I follow these existing conventions? (yes/no)
```

**You decide:** Conform to existing patterns or establish new standards!

- ✅ Completeness (all tech spec tasks covered)
- ✅ Clear dependency documentation

**Auto-fixes issues if found!**

---

## Complete User Journey

### Scenario 1: Bug Fix (Single Change)

**Goal:** Fix login validation bug

**Steps:**

1. **Start:** Load PM agent, say "I want to fix the login validation bug"
2. **PM runs tech-spec workflow:**
   - Asks: "What problem are you solving?"
   - You explain the validation issue
   - Detects your Node.js stack (Express 4.18.2, Jest for testing)
   - Analyzes existing UserService code patterns
   - Asks: "Should I follow your existing conventions?" → You say yes
   - Generates tech-spec.md with specific file paths and patterns
   - Creates story-login-fix.md
3. **Implement:** Load DEV agent, run `dev-story`
   - DEV reads tech-spec (has all context!)
   - Implements fix following existing patterns
   - Runs tests (following existing Jest patterns)
   - Done!

**Total time:** 15-30 minutes (mostly implementation)

---

### Scenario 2: Small Feature (Multi-Story)

**Goal:** Add OAuth social login (Google, GitHub)

**Steps:**

1. **Start:** Load PM agent, say "I want to add OAuth social login"
2. **PM runs tech-spec workflow:**
   - Asks about the feature scope
   - You specify: Google and GitHub OAuth
   - Detects your stack (Next.js 13.4, NextAuth.js already installed!)
   - Analyzes existing auth patterns
   - Confirms conventions with you
   - Generates:
     - tech-spec.md (comprehensive implementation guide)
     - epics.md (OAuth Integration epic)
     - story-oauth-1.md (Backend OAuth setup)
     - story-oauth-2.md (Frontend login buttons)
3. **Optional Sprint Planning:** Load SM agent, run `sprint-planning`
4. **Implement Story 1:**
   - Load DEV agent, run `dev-story` for story 1
   - DEV implements backend OAuth
5. **Implement Story 2:**
   - DEV agent, run `dev-story` for story 2
   - DEV implements frontend
   - Done!

**Total time:** 1-3 hours (mostly implementation)

## Tips and Best Practices

### 1. **Be Specific in Discovery**

When describing your change, provide specifics:

- ✅ "Fix email validation in UserService to allow plus-addressing"
- ❌ "Fix validation bug"

### 2. **Trust the Convention Detection**

If it detects your patterns correctly, say yes! It's faster than establishing new conventions.

### 3. **Use WebSearch Recommendations for Greenfield**

Starter templates save hours of setup time. Let Quick Spec Flow find the best ones.

### 4. **Review the Auto-Validation**

When validation runs, read the scores. They tell you if your spec is production-ready.

### 5. **Keep Single Changes Truly Atomic**

If your "single change" needs 3+ files, it might be a multi-story feature. Let the workflow guide you.

### 6. **Validate Story Sequence for Multi-Story Features**

When you get multiple stories, check the dependency validation output. Proper sequence matters!
